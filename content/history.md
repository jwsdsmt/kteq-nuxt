# History of KTEQ

KTEQ-FM began broadcasting in 1971 as the official college radio station of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.

From its early days on AM carrier current to full-power FM and streaming online, KTEQ has remained a platform for student creativity, alternative music, and community engagement.

In October 2025, KTEQ will be inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Rollers Hall of Fame, celebrating over five decades of broadcasting and culture.
