    <h1>History of KTEQ</h1>
    <h2>This page is under construction.</h2>

    <p>KTEQ-FM has been broadcasting since 1971 and has long served as a platform for alternative music, student expression, and community engagement. Below is a timeline of some key dates in the 100+ year history of SD Mines radio.</p>

    <p>In October 2025, KTEQ will be inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Rollers Hall of Fameâ€”recognizing decades of cultural and technical contributions to the state's soundscape.</p>
    
    <p>Between now and the induction ceremony we'll be working to update this page to focus on the stories of the students, faculty, staff, and administrators who've kept the station up and running, the musical connections they made, and the local artsists they inspired.</p>
